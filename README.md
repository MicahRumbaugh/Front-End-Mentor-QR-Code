## My process

I started out by refreshing my flexbox skills and brushing up on CSS. I started working from the outside to inside, initializing my classes and then adding the CSS to those classes. After adjusting font sizes, margin, colors, and the proper layout, I was able to finish with a product that is close to the original. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Through this challenge, I learned that even basic markup is important. It is easy to want to skip past the easy stuff and get to the nitty gritty in web development but remembering the basics and refining them is also beneficial. I am grateful for this challenge because it reminded me of how I started as a developer and how I want to continue to grow. 


### Continued development

I want to continue to improve my development skills and become a talented developer in the future. I want to continue learning FE and eventually delve more in depth to BE development. 

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - W3 helped me refresh my flexbox skills and brush up on my CSS.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - Youtube helped refresh my flexbox skills and brush up on my CSS as well.
